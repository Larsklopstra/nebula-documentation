## What is Nebula?

Nebula is a minimalistic and easy to use administration tool for Laravel applications, made with Laravel, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS.

Nebula makes you write less code and lets you focus more on the product by lessening the code required to build CRUD interfaces and metrics. Nebula offers a rich CLI and a set of metrics and form fields that does the heavy lifting for you.

## Made for you

Nebula is for Laravel developers who quickly want to scaffold professional-looking dashboards based on open-source software with functionalities such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting eloquent models and getting insights to data via metrics displayed as cards.

## Alternatives

Perhaps Nebula is not your cup of tea (yet.) But no worries, there are plenty of alternatives which may help you build your next project.
